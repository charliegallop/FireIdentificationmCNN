# FireIdentificationmCNN

# ToDo:

Meg:
- [ ] Change hyperparameters of SVM-CNN hybrid model to improve metrics
- [X] Look at implementing an SVM model
- [X] See if you can bias the output towards being risk adverse

Charlie
- [ ] Identify what images the models are missclassifying (sunsets?)
- [X] Test the TL models on another dataset
- [X] Look at recall, precision, AUC metrics instead of/as well as accuracy
- [X] Implement and compare different trasnfer learning models
- [X] Look into which ones would be 'light-weight' for remote sensing devices
